Explanation of shader

We used 3 different shaders (Outline, Hologram, Diffuse) And 2 Colorgradient to enhance the graphics of punch out.

The reason why we used outline is for contrast between the background and the players as well as being able to differentiate between the enemy and the player. We used diffuse for the player health due to the game using saturation to indicate health so we used diffused to achieve the same. Lastly we used hologram to override the previous shaders when the player gets hit because in the game when the player gets hits he flashers and holograms help us achieve the same.

LUTs: Used colour grading knowledge learned in class. Attached a script to camera do process the LUT. The two LUTs were made using a combination of the threshold and gradient map in photoshop. The LUTS were based off of one of Little Mac's smash costumes. We added the blue one to create a sense of impact while punching.


How we impleted this we first modify the hologram so that the rim because stronger and increased the width of the hologram and thats it

For out line and diffuse I then increased the saturation of the shadows so it wouldn't be fully black but made it a range so that if a player takes damage the saturation increases I then combined it with the outline which also saw a width increase.
