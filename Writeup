We used 3 different shaders (Outline, Hologram, Diffuse)
And 2 Colorgradient to enhance the graphics of punch out.

The reason why we used outline is for contrast between the background and the players aswell as beable to differentiante between the enemy and the player. We used diffuse for the player health due to the game using saturation to indicate health so we used diffused to achiee the same. 
Lastly we used hologram to override the previous shaders when the player gets hit because in the game when the player gets hits he flashers and holograms help us achieve the same.
